# Level 2 → Level 3
### Description
_The password for the next level is stored in a file called --spaces in this filename-- located in the home directory._
### Things to Know
**Trivia:** This problem was changed from its initial version, which asked you to read from a file named "spaces in this filename". It was given special characters to deter individuals from following a guide. I remember solving the initial problem, and having a good chuckle seeing it's revised form.
