# Level 5 → Level 6
### Description
_The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable
_
### Things to Know
We are looking for three things:
- **The file has to be human readable**. Meaning, there is a good chance the file we are looking for is ASCII text.
- **The file needs to be 1033 bytes in size**. We will need to use a command that can tell us the size of a file in bytes
- **The file needs to be a non-executable**. This means the file needs to be unable to execute, with no execute permissions for the owner, the group, or everyone.
