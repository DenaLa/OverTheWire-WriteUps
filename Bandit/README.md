# BANDIT RETROSPECTIVE AND WRITEUP
### Summary
A writeup for the Over The Wire game [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). Completed over a couple of weeks in October-November.

In the spirit of the wargame itself and Over The Wire's Goal:
- **There will be no passwords posted.** These passwords can change at any time, and the OverTheWire team has asked for them not to be shared.
- **If a file name is not explicitly stated in the description. it will not be stated in the soution write up**. This serves as a way to not only preserve a bit of the learning experience, but also future-proofs this write up in the event the file name changes in the future.
### Acknowledgements
Completed with the assistance of MayBeADev's write up, located [here](https://mayadevbe.me/posts/overthewire/bandit/level0/). The write up was used for later parts of this challenge where I had no familiarity with the systems present and did not know where to start.

**No Generative AI was used to complete this challenge.**
